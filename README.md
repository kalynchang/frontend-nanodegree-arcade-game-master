## Game

This was created from the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game Project starter code. Use the arrow keys to move your character around. The objective is to reach the water at the top of the game board. Once you reach the water, you win and will be sent back to the start. A counter at the top counts the number of times you have won. Try to avoid the bugs at all costs. If you hit a bug, you will be sent back to the start and your win counter will be reset.

## Instructions

To run the game, you can download the zip file, unzip it, open index.html in a browser,
and start playing. You can also clone the repository and open index.html in a browser to play.
